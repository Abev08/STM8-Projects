# STM8-Projects
Projects based on STM8 microcontroller.   
  
Projects in folders with _STVD in name were created in ST Visual Develop IDE with STM8 Cosmic C toolset using SPL (Standard Peripheral Library) from STMicroelectronics.

Starting STM8 Microcontrollers by Shawon M. Shahryiar was a great help ( http://embedded-lab.com/blog/starting-stm8-microcontrollers ). 
  
  
  
  
  
STVD is very bad at text formatting - when using external program to format text it will look bad in STVD and good looking text in STVD looks bad in external program.
